title: "Why do I want to farm Chia?"
---

Chia farming does not require a high end setup, infact there are negligible benefits to farming on a high end computer. You can farm Chia on the unused storage space of your mobile phone, laptop, existing PC, Mac, Raspberry pi, or corporate network, in return, you have the chance to receive rewards in chia for helping secure the blockchain. Our software will allow you to allocate a certain amount of unused disk space to create plots

Since the only resource intensive step is the initial plotting, once you download the Chia node software, your drives will be plotted in the background. Once plotting is complete, your computer will begin farming on your behalf and the software does all the work and tracks your rewards for you. Ongoing farming uses very little network bandwidth and almost no resources other than storage. 

The greenness of Chia is the ability to use idle storage, that would otherwise be sitting there domant on a PC or MAC. Utilising unused space is the unique selling point of Chia over alternative, high energy consuming cryptocurrencies. The alternative Proof of work cyptocurrencies on the market incentivise a race to harness the fastest hardware for maximum reward, thus producing a more centralised network of high energy consuming, wasteful mining farms. 

Chia makes the farming process available to anyone with unused disk space, we are moving towards our goal of a truly decentralized blockchain that will also serve as a cross subsidy to the storage and cloud industry.

Using idle space and low power computing capacity is what makes Chia so green. So no need to invest in the latest and greatest GPU or processors. Use what you already have!
